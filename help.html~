'<p> <a href="https://github.com/comcomist/privateq/archive/master.zip">Download</a> this app for offline use on your device.<br>\
 Generate iiaom only while working offline, when ToHname is ticked and IsText is unticked.<br>\
 And when "Is text" is ticked, click "As Table" after browsing a csv file, to get it as table, or click "To Edit" to be saved as something other.<br>\
 <div style="float:left; width:50%;border-style: groove; padding: 10px;"> <b>Generating <a href="http://namzezam.wikidot.com/blog:12" style="font-weight: bold" >iiaom</a>:</b> <br>\
 <b>1.</b> compress by (creating archive .zip or .7z)  with password ("other" options) to encrypt your image. <br>\
 <b>2.</b> browse and open the image file. <br>\
 <b>3.</b> browse and open the encrypted file. <br>\
 <b>4.</b> saveas in type of archive (.zip or .7z). <br>\
 <i>Notes:</i><br>\
   ‚Äè<b>1.</b> Your iiaom file can be used as your peer to peer Id card, while its file name as your id  for your communication (chat/email/webrtc), transactions (for reducing risk of middle man attack stealing your identity) or as your name in social networks, as well as a table-key for your private data, keeping your identity linked but isolated and encrypted by trustee.<br>\
 <b>2.</b> Your reputation number is calculated in base 32 as contacts*1024+1023*(contacts/signatures).<br>\
 <b>3.</b>In another file: iiaom-file-name.pub, the reputation number is kept togather with your pubkey and the signatures of your trustee you show\
 and for sorting by reputation use addtional empty iiaom-file-name.reputation.<br>\
 <b>4.</b>  <i>group inner usage:</i> Every user has the csv file corresponding to [table name] of which records are distributed (in attachment and in privteq protocol) in the mailing list of the group, as the table has: signature (Approver), iiaom(Approver),  iiaom(Approved), reputation(Approved). </p> \
<p><b>To do:</b><br> 1.The record as a file ready for attachment to be distributed.<br>\
 2. the record received in attachment added to the table .</p>\
</div>\
 <div style="float:left; width:50%;border-style: groove; padding: 10px;">\
 <p><b>PrivateQ protocol:</b><br>\
 Use '+ encApp + ' for your privateQ. <br>\
 PrivateQ is a protocol for Privately querying, while having  media storage secure, when sending to individuals or transmiting to specific group, while<br>\
 	    on the server, each fields is encrypted by the pub key of the scope defined by the column, where the scopes are: <br>\
 	     <b>0</b> of the data of owner of the record, <br>\
 	     <b>1</b> of data visible to the owner as one of many children of first ancestor etc.<br>\
 	    for reducing centralization: Tables holding such privateq could be downloaded to be cloned by its server users. <br>\

  <div class="clearleft"></div>\
  <div style="border-style: groove; padding: 10px;">\
  <p> <b>Use cases:</b><br>\
  Your iiaom can be used in combination with Tel number, email, address, paypal address, web address,\
     wallet-id etc, while using <i>privateq via mailing list distribution </i>.<br> \
Example: <a href="http://communal-coin.wikidot.com/" style="font-weight: bold" >Rcoin</a> in self organized and decentralized accessing by <i>sellers in multiple currencies price</i> and/or decentralized routing by <i>exchangers in p2p exchangers points</i>.\
  Use it as multiple currencies price is e.g. of 3 values like fiat-currencies-central-bank-money\
       (eg. euro, dollar or yuan), Cryptocurrency (eg. bitcoin ,peercoin, faircoin)\
        , and LETS (eg.tp, rcoin, ces), where sellers can act also as as exchangers (to reduce middle man).</p>\
