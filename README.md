 <p> Privately querying, for secure media storage, send to individuals and transmit to specific group:<br>
 	1. Online: by browser Downloading Encrypted Record to ( external - usb/sd) device.<br>
 	2. offline: a non browser application decrypt open the file and the record and save temporal file to ( external - usb/sd) device .<br>
 	3.  offline by browser open file in  csv format  and view its content as a table.<br>
 	4.  4 remove temp file.<br>
   Each fields is encrypted by the pub key of the scope defined by the column,
 	  where the scopes are: <br>
 	  0 of the data of owner of the record, <br>
 	  1 of data visible to the owner as one of many children of first ancestor etc.<br>
 	  for reducing centralization: Tables holding such privateq could be downloaded to be cloned by its server users. <br>
