 <p> Privately querying, for secure media storage, send to individuals and transmit to specific group:<br>
	  The "Ask" retrieve encrypted data, which, by the user's cut and paste to gpg of the client, <br>
	  is decrypted and then being paste back in csv format to be "View"ed as a table.<br> 	  
 	  Each fields is encrypted by the pub key of the scope defined by the column,
 	  where the scopes are: <br>
 	  0 of the data of owner of the record, <br>
 	  1 of data visible to the owner as one of many children of first ancestor etc.<br>
 	  for reducing centralization: Tables holding such privateq could be downloaded to be cloned by its server users. <br>
 	   </p> 
 	   
table of which each column is encrypted symmetrically by different key
